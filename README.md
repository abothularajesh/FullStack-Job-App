üßæ Job Application Portal
A full-stack web application designed to manage and display job postings. The project includes a React-based frontend, a Spring Boot backend, and a PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage.

üîß Tech Stack
  #Frontend: React (with basic UI and component-based architecture)
  
  #Backend: Java with Spring Boot (RESTful API)
  
  #Database: PostgreSQL
  
  #ORM: Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
  
  #API Communication: REST API using JSON over HTTP

üìå Project Description
   This project is a simple job application portal where users can view and manage job listings. It demonstrates full-stack development by connecting a lightweight frontend built in React to a backend powered by     Spring Boot, with persistent data stored in a PostgreSQL database.
  
   The backend exposes RESTful APIs for job-related operations such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting job posts. These endpoints are consumed by the frontend, enabling seamless communication and        real-time UI updates.

üé• Demo Video Prompt:

  "Create a demo video for my full-stack Job Application web app.
   The frontend is built using React with a simple UI, and the backend is built using Java with Spring Boot. The database used is PostgreSQL, connected to Spring Boot using JPA/Hibernate ORM. The frontend and        backend are connected using REST APIs.

üìÇ Features
‚úÖ Add new job posts (Title, Description, Location, etc.)

‚úÖ View all job listings

‚úÖ Update job details

‚úÖ Delete job posts

‚úÖ Frontend-backend integration using REST API

‚úÖ Data persistence using PostgreSQL

üöÄ How It Works
#Frontend (React):

Built with functional components and hooks.

Axios is used to send HTTP requests to the backend.

Minimal design focused on functionality.

#Backend (Spring Boot):

Exposes RESTful endpoints (/api/jobs, etc.)

Uses Spring Data JPA for ORM and database operations.

Connects to PostgreSQL using application properties.

#Database (PostgreSQL):

Stores job details in a relational table.

Connected via JDBC using Spring Boot configuration.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
#Backend (Spring Boot):-
Clone the repository and open in your preferred IDE.

Configure application.properties:

properties
Copy
Edit
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_db_name
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
Run the Spring Boot application (main() method in the main class).

#Frontend (React)
Navigate to the frontend directory.

**Install dependencies:
  npm install json server
  npm install
**Start the development server:
  npm start
üì¨ API Endpoints (Sample):

  GET	/api/jobs	Get all job posts
  POST	/api/jobs	Create a new job post
  PUT	/api/jobs/:id	Update an existing job
  DELETE	/api/jobs/:id	Delete a job post
